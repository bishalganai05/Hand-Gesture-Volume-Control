# Hand-Gesture-Volume-Control

This project uses computer vision techniques to create a hand gesture volume control application. The application uses the OpenCV library to detect hand landmarks, and then calculates the distance between the thumb and index finger. This distance is then used to control the volume of the computer's speakers.

## Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* OpenCV 4.5.5+
* MediaPipe 0.8.3+
* PyAutoGUI 0.9.5+
# Installation
* Install Python 3.8+.
* Install the OpenCV library.
* Install the MediaPipe library.
* Install the PyAutoGUI library.
# Usage
* Clone the GitHub repository.
* Open the project in a Python IDE, such as VS Code.
* Run the main.py file.
* Place your hand in front of the webcam.
* The application will detect your hand landmarks and calculate the distance between the thumb and index finger.
* The volume of the computer's speakers will be adjusted accordingly.
# To-Do
* Add more hand gestures for controlling the volume.
* Make the application more user-friendly.
* Improve the accuracy of the hand gesture detection.
